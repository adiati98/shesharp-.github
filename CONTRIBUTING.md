# Contributing Guidelines

Welcome to SheSharp! Thank you for considering contributing to our open source projects. Here you will find our general guidelines for contributing. Please note that certain repositories may have slightly different guidelines.

We appreciate all kinds of contributions. **However, we prioritize PRs from existing community members and underrepresented genders in tech to support our mission**.

We take our [Code of Conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md) very seriously, and all contributors must abide by it. Please take time to read it before contributing.

## New Contributors

If you're new to open source, check out the resources below to familiarize yourself with open source:

- [Git and GitHub learning resources](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/git-and-github-learning-resources)
- [Git Guide](https://github.com/git-guides)

## Working With Issues

If you find an issue you would like to work on, comment on it, and a maintainer will respond and assign it to you. Only work on changes and create a PR after it's assigned to you.

**We only accept PRs from contributors who get assigned to the issues**.

## How to Contribute

### 1. Finding Bugs or Suggesting Improvements

- If you find a bug or have a suggestion, [create a new issue](../../issues/new/choose).
- Select the appropriate template for bug reports or suggestions.
- Fill in the details and submit the issue.
- If you want to work on the issue, comment on it and _wait until a maintainer assigns it to you_ before you start work on changes.

### 2. Making Changes

- Clone your fork to your local machine and navigate to it:

- Create a new branch for your changes:

  git checkout -b your-feature
  ```

- Make your changes in the new branch.
- Add and commit your changes:

  git add .
  git commit -m "Brief description of your changes"
  ```

- Push your changes to your fork:

  ```bash
  git push origin your-feature
  ```
