# Contributing Guidelines

Welcome to SheSharp! Thank you for considering contributing to our open source projects. Before you get started, please take a moment to review our [Code of Conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md).

## Only PRs from Existing Community Members and Underrepresented Genders Will Be Accepted

As one of our missions is to support women and underrepresented genders, we only accept contributions from our community members and underrepresented genders.

If you haven't, join our community! Just hop on [our Slack](http://shesharp.co/slack) and say hello in the `#introductions` channel.

If that doesn't sound like you, you can still contribute by raising issues and helping our community improve their PRs by giving feedback.

## How to Contribute

### 1. Finding Bugs or Suggesting Improvements

- If you find a bug or have a suggestion, [create a new issue](../../issues/new/choose).
- Select the appropriate template for bug reports or suggestions.
- Fill in the details and submit the issue.

### 2. Ask to Be Assigned to an Issue

If you find an issue you want to work on, comment on it, and a maintainer will respond and assign it to you.

Please only work on changes after you get assigned to the issue. Maintainers might reject your PR if it's not the solution they seek or the issue is not their priority.

  git checkout -b your-feature
  ```

- Make your changes in the new branch.

  git commit -m "Brief description of your changes"
  ```
